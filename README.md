# domoticz_tahoma_blind
Domoticz plugin writen in Python to first support Velux IO roller shutters using Tahoma/Connexoon, but now it support: blinds, windows, garagedoor, screens and pergolas. Basic support of RTS (Open/Close) is also included without return state (limitation due to RTS), it means for RTS the state of the device won't be updated if the device state is modified outside of domoticz.

This plugin also comply with Somfy's rules about /setup endpoint, **if you are using an old version (previous to 2.0.0) you must update**

To use this plugin you need to install the last stable release of Domoticz https://www.domoticz.com and to install the required python library.

The plugin currently support the following device types: roller Shutters, screens (interior/exterior), awning, pergolas, garage door, windows and blinds(postions only, no slats control).
