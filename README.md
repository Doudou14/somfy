Basic support of RTS (Open/Close) is also included without return state (limitation due to RTS), it means for RTS the state of the device won't be updated if the device state is modified outside of domoticz.

The plugin currently support the following device types: roller Shutters, screens (interior/exterior), awning, pergolas, garage door, windows and blinds(postions only, no slats control).
